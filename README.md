- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @s3izures
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in comics, digital art, and... honestly I barely code, I daw more.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning C++ and C#
- ğŸ˜„ Pronouns: it/its, ai/aires, he/him
- âš¡ Fun fact: I'm currently running two comics. I have GitHub because I major in game programming. Getting there was a miracle.
